I just completed Wells Fargo's Software Engineering. In the simulation I:
Understood relevant requirements for building a system to manage financial portfolios
Figured out what data the system needed to keep track of
Drafted a visual representation of the data as an entity relationship diagram (ERD)
Used the IntelliJ developer application to implement the ERD and published it to GitHub
